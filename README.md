Odoo module - Ingram XML integration
====================================
This module is a fork of BHC module https://www.odoo.com/apps/7.0/Ingram/

This module provides an XML integration between Odoo and Ingram Micro Servers. It allows to maintain the Ingram product catalog and price list up to date automatically. It also provides a real-time integration for quotation, sales, purchases and deliveries. Actions in OpenERP generate requests toward Ingram to get informations, or to place an order directly, without using any external tool or website.
